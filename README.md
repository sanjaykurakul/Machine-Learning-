A collection of Machine Learning lab tasks, experiments, and reference implementations..

This repository contains all the Machine Learning tasks and experiments I completed during my lab work. 
The purpose of this repository is to:  
Save and organize my lab work in one place.  
Document different machine learning algorithms, models, and experiments.  
Provide reference code and explanations for future use.  
Share my learning progress and projects with others.  

Each folder or file in this repository corresponds to a specific machine learning task, covering topics such as:  
Data preprocessing  
Supervised and unsupervised learning  
Clustering and classification  
Dimensionality reduction  
Model evaluation and performance analysis  

This repo serves as a resource for anyone interested in machine learning fundamentals and practical tasks.
